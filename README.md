# Node Server that scales / Node Architecture that scales

This is a project that was forked from zafar-saleem, you can check the original [here](https://github.com/zafar-saleem/NodeScalableArchitecture). This one will be a bit of a rework, to work with Postgres, and Heroku.

## Get Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` inside its root folder.
3. run `npm start` (assuming the script `start` is correctly implemented.)

### Real world project
Soon.
